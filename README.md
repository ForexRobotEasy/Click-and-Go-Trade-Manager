## Click and Go Trade Manager:

This code represents a trading solution for Forex trading. The program allows traders to define stop loss, entry price, and target levels with a simple click on the chart. By eliminating the need for manual inputting of values, the software streamlines the trading process.

### Global Variables:

- `StopLoss`: Represents the stop loss level for a trade.
- `EntryPrice`: Represents the entry price for a trade.
- `TargetLevel`: Represents the target level for a trade.

### Event Handlers:

- `OnChartClick`: This event handler is triggered when the chart is clicked. It captures the x and y coordinates, button, clicks, and flags. If the button clicked is the left mouse button and there is a single click, the event handler calculates the entry price, stop loss level, and target level based on the current bid price. It then displays these calculated values using the `Comment` function.

### Initialization Function:

- `OnInit`: This function is called during the initialization of the program. It enables the chart click event by setting the `CHART_EVENT_CLICK` property to true.

### Deinitialization Function:

- `OnDeinit`: This function is called during the deinitialization of the program. It disables the chart click event by setting the `CHART_EVENT_CLICK` property to false.

### Main Program:

- `OnStart`: This function is the main program loop. It continuously executes trading logic as long as the program is not stopped. You can add your own trading logic within this loop.
